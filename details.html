<h1 class="descr">
    My name is Florin, and I am 21 yo. </br> 
    I am currently a student at the Faculty of Computer Science Iasi.</br>
    I like to work in teams, but also on my own, following my ideas.
    After I finished high school, I've got a certificate in web development, I'm a little rusty but I can catch up on you.
    I also have a digital marketing certificate and did some courses in SEO.
